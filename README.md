# What to do?
Fork this repository to your personal account.

Clone the repository onto your local machine.

Add a card about yourself in the same format as the ones already in the ```index.html``` file.

Make sure to add the new card inside of the ``<div>`` tag with ``classname="container"``.

## Card Template
```html

<div class="card">
  <h1>Replace this text with your name</h1>
  <br />
  <h2>Replace this text with a short sentence about yourself</h2>
</div>
```

# Then what
Create a new branch on your local machine.

Add your changes.

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

Push the new branch to your forked repo.

Create a pull request to merge this new branch with your master branch.

# See what you did
If you set up GitHub Pages (Settings > Scroll Down to "GitHub Pages" > Select main) then you can view the changes you've just made online!

Your github pages website should be viewable at ``https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-forked-repo-name>/``. You can see our repo at: https://utd-gwc.github.io/intro-to-github/.

Be patient when looking to see new changes on this free website as GitHub Pages is often slow to update.
